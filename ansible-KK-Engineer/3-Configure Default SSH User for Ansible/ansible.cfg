# The Nautilus DevOps team aims to manage all servers within the stack using Ansible,utilizing a common sudo user across all
# servers. They plan to use this user for various tasks on each server. While this isn't finalized, they're starting with testing.
# Ansible is already installed on the jump host via yum. Here's the requirement:
# On the jump host, modify the default configuration of Ansible to enable the use of ammar as the default SSH user for all hosts.
# Ensure to make changes within Ansible's default configuration without creating a new one.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete  and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg
